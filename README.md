# yukiparse

An improvement upon [this](https://github.com/ephing/dragontrials/tree/main/trial3and4)

I added some CLI flags and also semantic action support into the specification for grammars.

Parsers output from yukiparse are dependent on a lexer such as [yunolex](https://github.com/ephing/yunolex), or any other lexer that outputs token streams in the same format.

Example specifications can be seen in [yunolex](https://github.com/ephing/yunolex/blob/main/parser/docs/regex.grammar), which was bootstrapped to use a parser generated by itself and yukiparse, and in [doodooDB](https://github.com/ephing/doodooDB/blob/master/docs/sql.grammar), which uses the pair to generate a partial SQL parser.

I intend to eventually rewrite this project from the ground up *again*, at which point I'll flesh out the documentation to be actually useful.
